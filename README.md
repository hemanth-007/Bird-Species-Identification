# Bird-Species-Identification 🦜🔍

Bird Species Identification is an end-to-end CNN Image Classification Model which identifies the bird species in an image. It can identify over 275 different bird species.

It is based upon pre-trained Image Classification Models that comes with Keras and then retrained on the [**Bird Species Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species).
